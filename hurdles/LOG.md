# Hurdles log

Append-only. One entry per unit of work, newest last. Format:
`## YYYY-MM-DD — wN <phase>: <piece or scope>`, then 1 to 5 lines on what happened and
where the outputs are.

## 2026-09-25 — setup (run 1)

- Created the project: static `index.html` with an import map, three.js 0.186.1 in
  `node_modules/`, and a placeholder `src/main.js` (a spinning cube that implements
  a minimal `window.__GR`).
- Tooling: `tools/capture.cjs` (headless Chromium via global Playwright 1.62, WebGL
  through SwiftShader, about 60 fps on a trivial scene), `tools/sheet.cjs`, and
  `tools/blind.cjs`. All three were verified end to end on the placeholder.
- The user installed a full system ffmpeg (8.0.1, `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`), which handles
  mp4/h264 references and audio spectrograms. The ffmpeg bundled with Playwright is
  stripped, so never use it.
- itch.io is reachable over HTTPS from this machine.
- Decomposed the game into 15 pieces (`hurdles/pieces.json`): foundation (not judged)
  plus 14 judged pieces. The build wave has not run. `state.json` points at wave 1,
  phase `build`, with `foundation` first in the queue.

## 2026-09-25 — w1 build: foundation

- Builder built the engine skeleton in `src/core/` and `src/render/voxel/` and rewrote `src/main.js`. It includes a fixed 60 Hz loop, input with buffering, a scene machine, seeded RNG, a greedy mesher with AO, a showcase router with an unknown-id error screen, and `window.__GR`.
- Cross-piece edits: it created `src/render/palette.js` (owned by `look`) and changed `src/style.css`. Notes are in `waves/w1/build/foundation.md`.
- Smoke test: showcase, title and run all exit 0 with non-blank frames. The gamepad path is untested.

## 2026-09-25 — w1 build: budget stop

- The budget guard tripped after foundation: weekly usage was 97%, over the 95% limit, and resets Sat 26 Sep 21:00. The next session resumes the build queue at `look`.
